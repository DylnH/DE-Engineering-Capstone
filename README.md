## Project Proposal

### Summary of Project Idea
Teachers these days are underpaid and underappreciated. Due to chaotic students and the pandemic, Teacher's stress levels are at a all time high. 
Our solution to this issue is to make a portable Guitar Hero Station for teachers to use, so that they can take a break from the stress that comes with teaching. This helps out our school because this would cause the stress levels of the teachers to decrease, which would lead to a happier learning/teaching environment. We are satisfied with our produce, if we are able to make multiple working controllers that check off the essential requirments, as well as fulfill a teachers inner desire to shred on guitar.

Essential Requirements Include...

- 2-4 Working Controllers
- Portable
- Haptic Feedback
- USB Compatible
- Comparable, if not better than the original controller.

Non-Essential Requirements Include...

- Easy and Satisfying to use
- Able to Fix with relative ease
- Cool Design
- Use the new equipment in the Sigma Lab
- Make a controller that's Console Compatible

### Timeline
We plan on accomplishing at least one facet of the project each week, as well as documentation. We'll gives ourselves leeway if certain things turn out to be harder than previously thought. We can complete each step by making the controllers top to bottom. Headstock, frets, neck, body, etc. If we narrow down each step by parts (one week, we'll work on LEDs), we could complete a step weekly.
### Materials/Budget

- [Arduino Pro Micro Controller 2x](https://envistiamall.com/products/pro-micro-atmega32u4-5v-16mhz-leonardo-arduino-compatible) $9
- Wires and Breadboard
- 3D printed Material
- Acrylic
- Mechanical Buttons
- USB Cables
### Deliverables
We will give a Presentation and Demo to present our finish product. We'll show how it works, show to process, and teach the audience every they would want to know about our creation. after that, we'll show it working and our new huge a** monitors.
### References
There are a hundred different ways to do references and I'm not going to tell you which one to use (Links to an external site.), but you need references and those should be cited within your paper.  If this proposal is any good, it will be rich in research and technical details.  Those will come from sources and those sources need to be cited.
