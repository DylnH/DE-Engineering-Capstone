# Guitar Hero Controller

## Project Proposal

### Summary of Project Idea
Teachers these days are underpaid and underappreciated. Due to chaotic students and the pandemic, Teacher's stress levels are at a all time high. 
Our solution to this issue is to make a portable Guitar Hero Station for teachers to use, so that they can take a break from the stress that comes with teaching. This helps out our school because this would cause the stress levels of the teachers to decrease, which would lead to a happier learning/teaching environment. We are satisfied with our produce, if we are able to make multiple working controllers that check off the essential requirments, as well as fulfill a teachers inner desire to shred on guitar.

Essential Requirements Include...

- 2-4 Working Controllers
- Portable
- Haptic Feedback
- USB Compatible
- Comparable, if not better than the original controller.

Non-Essential Requirements Include...

- Easy and Satisfying to use
- Able to Fix with relative ease
- Cool Design
- Use the new equipment in the Sigma Lab
- Make a controller that's Console Compatible

### Timeline
How do you plan on meeting each of your requirements?
In what order will you complete each step?
How much time do you anticipate each step will take (THIS IS IMPORTANT!)?
### Materials/Budget

- Arduino Micro Controller
- Wires adn Breadboard
- 3D printed Material
- Acrylic
- 
### Deliverables
What will you be turning at the end of the year?
Do you plan on also submitting a Technical Report, Edited Video, or giving a Presentation?
### References
There are a hundred different ways to do references and I'm not going to tell you which one to use (Links to an external site.), but you need references and those should be cited within your paper.  If this proposal is any good, it will be rich in research and technical details.  Those will come from sources and those sources need to be cited.
