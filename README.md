## Project Proposal

### Summary of Project Idea
Teachers these days are underpaid and underappreciated. Due to chaotic students and the pandemic, Teacher's stress levels are at a all time high. 
Our solution to this issue is to make a portable Guitar Hero Station for teachers to use, so that they can take a break from the stress that comes with teaching. This helps out our school because this would cause the stress levels of the teachers to decrease, which would lead to a happier learning/teaching environment. We are satisfied with our produce, if we are able to make multiple working controllers that check off the essential requirments, as well as fulfill a teachers inner desire to shred on guitar.

Essential Requirements Include...

- 2-4 Working Controllers
- Portable
- Haptic Feedback
- USB Compatible
- Comparable, if not better than the original controller.

Non-Essential Requirements Include...

- Easy and Satisfying to use
- Able to Fix with relative ease
- Cool Design
- Use the new equipment in the Sigma Lab
- Make a controller that's Console Compatible

### Timeline
We plan on accomplishing at least one facet of the project each week, as well as documentation. We'll gives ourselves leeway if certain things turn out to be harder than previously thought. We can complete each step by making the controllers top to bottom. Headstock, frets, neck, body, etc. If we narrow down each step by parts (one week, we'll work on LEDs), we could complete a step weekly.

#### Rough Idea
Week 1 - Planning

Week 2 - Buttons

Week 3 - Buttons Pt 2.

Week 4 - ???

Week 5 - ???

### Materials/Budget

- [Arduino Leonardo Micro 2x](https://www.tinyosshop.com/index.php?route=product/product&product_id=930) $17.6
- [Low Profile mechanical keyboard switches (1 Pack of 10)](https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=6337) $9
- 3D printed Material
- Resin printed Material
- Acrylic
- Wires and Breadboard
- USB Cables
### Deliverables/Measuring Success
We will give a Presentation and Demo to present our finish product. We'll show how it works, show to process, and teach the audience every they would want to know about our creation. after that, we'll show it working and our new huge a** monitors. If we can create a controller that works, and enjoyable to use, then we consider that a success.

### Plan/Jobs

#### Dylan will work on...
- Internals of Controller.
- Coding
- Mild CAD Work
- Assembly

#### Owen will work on...
- Externals of Controller
- CAD
- Cosmetic/Design
- Assembly

## Documentation

### Week 0

### Weekly Update.

- This week, we researched and found different ways to make/modify Guitar Hero Controllers
- We've decided on what some of the materials should be. (what parts should be 3D printed and laser cut)
- We've found a few resources that shows how others created their own controllers. Plus a source that explains how haptic feedback works.
- Nothing has gone wrong so far because there hasn't enough time for things to go wrong.
- Next week, we'll expand on our proposal, to make it more detailed.

### CAD Documentation

- This is the first Onshape model of the guitar. It only shows the top view of the guitar but had all the necessary holes cut for various buttons.
