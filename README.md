# Guitar Hero Controller

## Project Proposal

### Summary of Project Idea
Teachers these days are underpaid and underappreciated. Due to chaotic students and the pandemic, Teacher's stress levels are at a all time high. Our solution to this issue is to make a portable Guitar Hero Station for Teachers to use, so that they can take a break from the stress that comes with teaching.
This helps out our school because the staff's stress levels would decrease, which would lead to a happier learning/teaching environment.
What are your essential and non-essential requirements?
How will you measure the success of meeting each requirement?
### Timeline
How do you plan on meeting each of your requirements?
In what order will you complete each step?
How much time do you anticipate each step will take (THIS IS IMPORTANT!)?
### Materials/Budget
What type of micro-controller do you plan on using?
What materials from the lab will you be able to use?
What materials and costs do you anticipate needing to complete the project?
### Deliverables
What will you be turning at the end of the year?
Do you plan on also submitting a Technical Report, Edited Video, or giving a Presentation?
### References
There are a hundred different ways to do references and I'm not going to tell you which one to use (Links to an external site.), but you need references and those should be cited within your paper.  If this proposal is any good, it will be rich in research and technical details.  Those will come from sources and those sources need to be cited.
